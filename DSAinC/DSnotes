Big O Notation
    Fastest: O(1); Accessing element or finding and element in index
    2nd fast: O(log n); cutting a problem in half
    3rd fast: O(n); Going through element at a time
    medium: O(n log n); Sorting
    slow: O(n^2); nested loops, brute forcing
    



Arrays
    -Accessing O(1)
        Goes to the exact location in the array because of indexes
    -Appending at the end O(1)
        Adds to end of the list
    -Appenind at the beginning o(n)
        Has to shift every elememt to the right to add at the beginning
    -Useful Scenerios 
        -Traverse a structure in order
        -Access a specific indexes
        -Compare elements from both ends

Strings: Fast look up, smart windowing and fast traversal
    -Strings are immutable; Creates new string when modifying
    -Useful scenerios
        Find the longest substring without repeating characters
        Check if two strings are anagrams
        Return all substrings that match a pattern

Sets: tracking 
    -Collection of unique elements
    -Useful scenerios
        -uniquess
        -Existence
        -Fast membership checks
        -Sliding window
